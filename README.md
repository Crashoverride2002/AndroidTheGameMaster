# AndroidTheGameMaster
The master for collecting data.

With this app you can collect geographical data and pictures on the game it self and these will then be passed to the game server where you can work on them

# How does it work ?

A. you go out to the real world tag the loc button and get a geolocation, then you can take pictures as well and write a short description, this gets put into a project for the Game it self, if a game is not created the app will ask you to create a game, a game is an empty shell with location start description splash screen and a set of direction, these can be cryptic, so the gamer needs to have his or her wits about them other wise they might not get the clue or figure out the problem.

B. Once a game is created and a location is tagged the location can then be a starting point for that quest, each quest can have an uncounted number of points to it with various forms of tasks, can be you need to gather fysical clues along the way and these need to be assembled to form another clue that will unlock various questes on the game your playing, or will be part of the solution to a gory crime only the creator of that game will know its full details.

C. once you have collected all the points on the game map in what ever part of the world, you will go to a site where you will write out the clues of the games the task of the game and the points, and once all is finished you can chose to publish the game.

A game can have treasure tokens or other items that you collect in the fysical world, or it can simply be a status update in the game it self.
